# Zonal-Statistics-Automation-Tool
This was a tool developed to automate GIS Zonal Statistics with multiple raster.
The tool takes in multiple raster and a vector polygon as the input for the statistics.
It joins all the resulting table into a single table are presents it to the user.
This saves the user a lot of time when working with several rasters as one will have to join the tables together after each zonal statistics is performed with a single raster.
